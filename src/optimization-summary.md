# Steel Rift Builder: Code Structure Optimizations

## Completed Optimizations:

### 1. Created Reusable UI Components
- `BubbleDisplay.vue` - For defense/armor/structure displays
- `FormSelect.vue` - Standardized form select fields
- `Button.vue` - Reusable button component
- `Card.vue` - Card container component
- `SelectedItem.vue` - Component for displaying selected items in lists

### 2. Created Constants and Utility Files
- `constants.js` - Central location for application constants
- `formatters.js` - Utility functions for formatting display data
- `testHelpers.js` - Helpers for creating test data

### 3. Created Service Layer
- `printService.js` - Extracted print functionality into a proper service

### 4. Added Tailwind Component Classes
- `components.css` - Extracted common Tailwind class combinations into reusable components

### 5. Created Integration Guide
- `integration-guide.md` - Guide for integrating reusable components into hevCustomizer.vue

## Next Steps:

1. **Integrate Reusable Components**: Follow the integration guide to update hevCustomizer.vue with the new components.

2. **Convert Inline Styles to Tailwind Classes**: Replace any remaining inline styles with Tailwind utility classes or component classes.

3. **Implement Test Coverage for New Components**: Create tests for the reusable UI components.

4. **Refactor SupportAssets Component**: Apply the same component-based approach to the SupportAssets.vue file.

5. **Evaluate App.vue Refactoring**: Consider breaking down App.vue into smaller, focused components.

6. **Update Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all components and functions for better maintainability.

7. **Implement Memoization**: Add memoization for expensive calculations to improve performance.

## Expected Benefits:

- **Enhanced Readability**: Standardized components with clear naming
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized constants and utilities
- **Better Code Organization**: Proper separation of concerns with services
- **Consistent Styling**: Reusable component classes for UI elements
- **More Robust Testing**: Easier to test isolated components
