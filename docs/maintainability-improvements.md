# Steel Rift Builder - Maintainability Improvements

This document details the maintainability improvements implemented for the Steel Rift Builder application.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. UI Component Extraction
- Created a reusable `StatDisplay` component for consistently presenting numerical values
- Extracted HE-V configuration into smaller, focused components:
  - `ChassisClassSelector` - Handles chassis class selection and display
  - `MotiveSystemSelector` - Handles motive system selection and display
  - `ArmorStructureModifier` - Handles armor/structure modification

### 2. Error Handling
- Created a centralized `errorService` for consistent error handling throughout the app
- Added global error handling in main.js to catch unhandled exceptions
- Implemented typed error categories for different error scenarios
- Added proper error tracking and reporting with user notifications

### 3. Form Validation
- Created a reusable `useFormValidation` composable for validating forms
- Added centralized validation in `unitValidation.js` service
- Separated validation logic from UI components for better separation of concerns

### 4. State Management
- Improved the existing Pinia store implementation
- Set up proper integration with Vue 3 and the global error system
- Implemented consistent error handling in the store actions

### 5. Documentation
- Created a comprehensive maintainability plan
- Added JSDoc documentation to all new components and functions
- Created descriptive component names and organization

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Code Organization**: 
   - Smaller, more focused components improve readability
   - Clear separation between UI, logic, and state management
   - Components are organized by domain (hev, ui, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Smaller components are easier to understand, test, and modify
   - Reusable components reduce code duplication
   - Consistent patterns make the codebase more predictable

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error reporting throughout the application
   - Improved user experience with appropriate error messages
   - Better debugging through centralized error tracking

4. **Improved Testing**:
   - Smaller, focused components are easier to test
   - Separation of concerns allows for more targeted tests
   - Services can be tested independently from UI components

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Decomposition**:
   - Further break down large components like `hevCustomizer.vue` and `SupportAssets.vue`
   - Extract weapon and upgrade selection logic into dedicated components

2. **State Management Migration**:
   - Move more state from App.vue into appropriate stores
   - Create additional stores for different domains as needed

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Increase test coverage for the new components
   - Standardize testing patterns across the codebase

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement proper memoization for expensive computations
   - Add lazy loading for larger components
